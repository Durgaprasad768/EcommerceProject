# EcommerceProject

This project is a foundational Java application demonstrating the core structure of a basic e-commerce system. It's a command-line application designed to illustrate fundamental object-oriented principles and software architecture.

## Key Components

* **Model:** Represents the data entities (e.g., `Product`).
* **Service:** Handles the business logic (e.g., `ProductService`).
* **Controller:** Manages user interactions (e.g., `ProductController`).
* **Utility:** Contains utility classes, including the `Main` class.

## Functionality

* Allows adding product information.
* Lists all added products.

## Purpose

* Educational project to demonstrate basic e-commerce architecture.
* Practice with object-oriented design and layered architecture.

## How to Run

1.  Compile the Java files: `javac src/controller/ProductController.java src/model/Product.java src/service/ProductService.java src/util/Main.java`
2.  Run the application: `java util.Main`

## Future Enhancements

* Database integration.
* User authentication.
* Shopping cart functionality.
* Web interface.
