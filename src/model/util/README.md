# EcommerceProject

This is a basic Java project that sets up the foundational structure for an e-commerce application. It includes:

* **Model:** Represents the data of the application (e.g., `Product`).
* **Service:** Contains the business logic (e.g., `ProductService`).
* **Controller:** Handles user interactions (e.g., `ProductController`).
* **Util:** Utility classes (e.g., `Main` for testing).

This project is a starting point for building a more complete e-commerce application.

## Future Enhancements

* Database integration (e.g., using JDBC or JPA).
* User authentication and authorization.
* Shopping cart functionality.
* Order management.
* User interface (e.g., using JavaFX or Spring MVC).

This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate basic e-commerce concepts and project structure.
